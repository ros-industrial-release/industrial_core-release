ros-kinetic-industrial-robot-simulator (0.4.0-0xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Fixed roslaunch test dependency and build depends for robot simulator package
  * Corrected roslaunch test and added rospy depends to industrial_robot_simulator package
  * Removed extraneous dependencies.  Re-enable launch test
  * robot_simulator: add TU Delft copyright as well.
  * robot_simulator: add BSD license header. Fix #90 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_core/issues/90>.
  * robot_simulator: set explicit queue size in Publishers. Fix #99 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_core/issues/99>.
    Queue size of 1 is most likely sufficient for these topics.
  * robot_simulator: add GetRobotInfo svc server.
  * robot_simulator: quiet down node (use logdebug()).
  * Merge pull request #88 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_core/issues/88> from gavanderhoorn/rob_sim_robot_status
    Add RobotStatus publishing to robot simulator node
  * robot_simulator: remove redundant load_manifest(). Fix #63 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_core/issues/63>.
  * robot_simulator: update manifest (depend on industrial_msgs).
  * robot_simulator: publish RobotStatus msgs as well.
  * robot_simulator: make initial joint state configurable. Fix #73 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_core/issues/73>.
