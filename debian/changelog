ros-kinetic-industrial-robot-client (0.5.0-0jessie) jessie; urgency=high

  * Start checking for trajectory completion as soon as the first moving status arrives
  * Forces the action to wait for half of the duration of the trajectory
    before it begins to check for completition. This prevents the action
    for returning immediately for trajectories that end near the start
    point and are slow to start moving.
  * Merge pull request #115 <https://github.com/shaun-edwards/industrial_core/issues/115> from Jmeyer1292/issue#114 <https://github.com/Jmeyer1292/issue/issues/114>`__start_tolerance_check Issue`#114 <https://github.com/shaun-edwards/industrial_core/issues/114> - Action Server withinGoalConstraints check removal
  * Revert "Revert "Merge pull request #113 <https://github.com/shaun-edwards/industrial_core/issues/113> from simonschmeisser/indigo""
    This reverts commit fb28e26fdbd3c316941d4d66af2f1c9b5410cb0d.
  * Removed withinTolerance check from the accept function

  * Fill stamp of the RobotStatus message Fix: #97 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_core/issues/97>
    Just edited on a github didn't test it.
  * Only accept goals after reception of controller feedback. Fix #85 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_core/issues/85>.
  * robot_client: workaround for #46 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_core/issues/46>. Fix #67 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_core/issues/67>.
    This is an updated version of the workaround committed in 9df46977. Instead
    of requiring dependent packages to invoke the function defined in the
    CFG_EXTRAS cmake snippet, the snippet now sets up the linker path directly.
    Dependent packages now only need to remember to explicitly list their
    dependency on industrial_robot_client and simple_message in their
    add_library(..) statements.
