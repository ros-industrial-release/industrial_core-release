ros-kinetic-simple-message (0.5.1-0wily) wily; urgency=high

  * Temporary fix, commented out disabled test to remove unstable build status
  * Changed test port numbers to unused range in linux.  utest_message now uses port range defined by macros (addresses failure to init server socket)
  * Amend to pull request #153 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_core/issues/153> (methods moved to TypedMessage)
  * robot_status: missing reply to SERVICE_REQUEST. Fix in robot_status_message and relay_handler.
  * simple_message: add doc to SpecialSeqValue enum members.
  * simple_message: fix SpecialSeqValue typo. Fix #130 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_core/issues/130>.

ros-kinetic-simple-message (0.5.0-0wily) wily; urgency=high

  * Switch ByteArray to <deque> for internal buffer
    - enables dynamic sizing, for larger messages
    * up to INT_MAX, which is unadvised
    - allows efficient data access at front/rear of msgs
    - maintains same external API
    * getRawDataPtr() is deprecated (not contiguous memory)
    - bugFix: SimpleSocket::receiveBytes() buffer-size check
    - update unit tests to handle ByteArray.MaxSize==INT_MAX

ros-kinetic-simple-message (0.4.0-0wily) wily; urgency=high

  * Moved common socket contstructor code to simple_socket base class
  * Updated simple message header to reflect vendor ranges specified in REP-I0004
  * Correctly initialized connected state for udp connections
  * Fixed issue #48 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_core/issues/48>, logSocketError is now passed errno
  * Merge pull request #70 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_core/issues/70> from gt-ros-pkg/hydro-devel
    Fixing receiveBytes for UDP
  * Macro'ed out GETHOSTBYNAME, and fixed if-statement braces to be on a new line for consistency
  * Added support for gethostbyname, for passing host names in addition to IP addresses.
  * Making setConnected protected again, adding setDisconnected to public methods so that that method can be used to flag the connection as disconnected.
  * Putting back in timeout for receiveBytes
  * More formal fix for UDP communication.
    This should now make UDP sockets act almost exactly like the
    TCP sockets.
  * Fixing receiveBytes for UDP
  * robot_client: workaround for #46 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_core/issues/46>. Fix #67 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_core/issues/67>.
    This is an updated version of the workaround committed in 9df46977. Instead
    of requiring dependent packages to invoke the function defined in the
    CFG_EXTRAS cmake snippet, the snippet now sets up the linker path directly.
    Dependent packages now only need to remember to explicitly list their
    dependency on industrial_robot_client and simple_message in their
    add_library(..) statements.

ros-kinetic-simple-message (0.3.1-0wily) wily; urgency=high

  * Added polling check to socket read and muiltiple read calls in order to receive all desired bytes
  * Removed library export from catkin macro.  Packages that depend on these must declare library dependencies explicitly (by name)
  * Add error message to socket errors (instead of just errno).
  * Converted to catkin
